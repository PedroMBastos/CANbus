# CANbus
Controlled Area Network (CAN) is used in several industries. The network is characterized as a low cost, fast and robust network. The flexibility associated with the network makes it very easy to add or remove nodes or use diagnostic tools to debug any issue. On this repository, there is a CANbus base structure (virtual) capable of supporting an x ammount of nodes.
For this lib to work with only a LINUX machine can-utils needs to be installed.
Can-utils is designed to let LINUX communicate with CAN Networks.
